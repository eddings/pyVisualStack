**pyVisualStack**

AUTHORS: Ryan Collins, Henry Phu, Alex Doliner 

The authors crated pyVisualStack at yHack 2013 as part of the data 
visualiztion challenge. 

USAGE:

1)
First you must install Python Call Graph which can be found: 

https://github.com/gak/pycallgraph/blob/master/docs/index.rst

For detailed installation instructions of Python Call Graph see:

http://pycallgraph.slowchop.com/en/master/#quick-start

2)
From there just download the .py files yhack.html and use the following 
syntax for GNU/linux terminals with python already installed:

$ python pyHandler.py <.py file to observe> 

DISCLAIMERS:

The authors are not exactly accustom to writing universal code. This 
program will only work on Limux and we are not sure if it will work 
properly in any case, but the few tests we have done have been 
promising. Finally, python programs with user input do not work at this
time.
